how to use

-pip install poetry


-poetry install


-python manage.py runserver



-celery -A DjangoProjectTest worker --pool=solo -l info -E


I used windows for this project so without a broker.


Further just go to the site, click register and create a new user, in the console celery - should appear information and code, it can be inserted and there will be more information about the justification of the letter of thanks.
